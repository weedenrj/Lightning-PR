# Lightning PR Core Standards

Universal coding standards that apply to all code in the Lightning PR codebase.

## Core Rules - Never Compromise

- **NO .env FILE ACCESS**: Never read or write to environment files under any circumstance
- **NO SEMICOLONS**: Code should not end lines with semicolons
- **NO COMMENTS**: Never write comments in source code
- **USE CONST EXCLUSIVELY**: Always use `const` for variable declarations, never `let` or `var`
- **IMMUTABLE CODE ONLY**: Transform data through pure functions and spreads, never mutate existing objects
- **NO IIFES**: Never write functions and then immediately execute them
- **KEEP IT SIMPLE**: Prefer the simplest solution that matches existing patterns
- **FOLLOW EXISTING PATTERNS**: Search the codebase before introducing new helpers or abstractions

## Planning & Execution

- **Understand what exists**: Search for similar patterns before implementing new logic
- **Minimize surface area**: Prefer small, targeted changes over refactors
- **Keep code self-documenting**: Prefer clear naming and structure over explanatory comments

## TypeScript & React

- **Prefer pure functions**: Move complex logic into small helpers with descriptive names
- **Avoid hook cleverness**: Don’t add `useMemo`/`useCallback`, avoid `useEffect` unless explicitly requested

## Logging

- **NO LOGGING WITHOUT PERMISSION**: Never add logging statements without explicit user approval
