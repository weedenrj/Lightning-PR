# Lightning PR Skills Reference

Quick reference guides for implementing common patterns in the Lightning PR codebase. Skills are colocated with their related code for easy discovery.

## Skill Document Guidelines

Skills should be concise (under 100 lines), human-readable, and focus on broader patterns rather than exhaustive step-by-step instructions.

**Structure (flexible, not prescriptive):**
- Brief intro explaining what the pattern is
- Core concept or approach
- Key components you'll need
- Reference to example files
- Non-obvious gotchas only

Write conversationally, like explaining to a colleague. Point to examples rather than documenting every detail. Leave room for interpretation.

## Skills Index

Skills are managed in the `.cursor/skills/` directory. Each skill has a `SKILL.md` file with proper metadata and progressive disclosure structure.

**CRITICAL: This index must always maintain perfect parity with the actual skills in this repo.** When creating, updating, or removing skills, this JSON index must be updated immediately to reflect all skills in `.cursor/skills/`.

**Maintenance Requirements:**
- Scan `.cursor/skills/` for all subdirectories containing `SKILL.md` files
- Extract `name` and `description` from each skill's YAML frontmatter
- Update this JSON index to include all discovered skills
- Remove skills from index when they are deleted from directories
- Keep categories accurate and consistent
